## Optimal Asset Allocation 

This project aims to provide clients with optimal investment portfolios tailored to their desired returns. Leveraging the Yahoo Finance library, we gather real-time financial data to analyse and construct portfolios that maximise returns while managing risk. Whether clients are seeking aggressive growth or conservative stability, our customised asset allocation strategies ensure their investment goals are met effectively.

Key features of this project include:

- **Data Analysis**: Utilising the Yahoo Finance library to collect and analyse up-to-date financial data.
- **Portfolio Optimisation**: Employing mathematical models and algorithms to determine the optimal asset allocation for different risk-return profiles.
- **Client Customisation**: Tailoring portfolios to meet the specific investment objectives and risk tolerances of individual clients.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Implementing tools to monitor portfolio performance over time and make necessary adjustments to maintain alignment with client goals.

With this project, clients can make informed investment decisions backed by data-driven insights, ultimately achieving their financial objectives with confidence.
